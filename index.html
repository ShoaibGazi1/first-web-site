            <p>
                Teaching myself web design was more difficult than teaching myself graphic
                design, which is why I invested a little bit more money into learning web
                design. However, I kept my budget to less than $100 to learn web design so
                I wouldn’t say I spent an outrageous amount (and I earned it back as soon
                as I began offering web design services).

            <h1>Future Goal</h1>
            <h3>Become a web developer</h3>
            <p>Being a graphic designer at heart and former graffiti artist in my early teens, I was drawn to the
                prospect of designing on the web. I saw the web as a way to legitimately express my creations across the
                world. And so back in the pre-Dreamweaver days of web design (early 90’s), I started using NetObjects
                Fusion and began learning how to design websites from a GUI perspective.</p>
